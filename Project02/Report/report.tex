\begin{abstract}
Sentiment classification is an active area of research in the field of machine learning. Here, we present the results of a study into supervised learning methods for classifying the emotional sentiment of Tweets -- either positive, or negative -- according to the presence of an emoticon. To this end, we leverage state-of-the-art pre-processing and feature engineering methods, and provide a comparison of learning methods that make use of the resultant features. Finally, we describe in detail the best model we identified for this purpose: \textcolor{blue}{Convolutional neural network, I suppose}, which achieved \textcolor{blue}{x accuracy} on unseen data.
